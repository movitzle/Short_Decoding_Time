*** NEED TO CHANGE BACK***
start was edited to include some more c points, change the call back to main.m

delete main_update - it is only to load data and simulate for small cs and include it into the saved variables



1. Run start.

2. Run plot_1d.m for plots of result and get the approximation
Note that if you change the parameters in Start, you need to manually change them in plot_1d.m too
(such as the width, number of neurons, average peak amplitude etc)


workspace_D_1 and workspace_D_1_small_c are from Supp-simulations/MSE_L_2, copied them here to include in new figure
