How to run:

1. Make this the root folder in MATLAB path
2. (Optional) Run create_params.m in /utils to create a new set of shared parameters
3. Run start_Fig4_b_d.m, ... or start_Fig6.m 
4. Run plotting programs

Note that the figures are saved in the Results folder. 
More precisely, in the corresponding subfolder of Results, "alpha_X" where X is the chosen value of alpha in the simulation.
